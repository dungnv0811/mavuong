# H2 Console and API Demo

This guide shows how to open the H2 console and exercise the REST API with curl.

## Start the app

```bash
# From construction/appointment_booking
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Dev security is open (`security.cognito.enabled=false`), so no JWT is required.

## H2 Console

- URL: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:healthapp`
- User: `sa`
- Password: (leave empty)

Notes
- Schema and sample data are loaded automatically from `src/main/resources/schema.sql` and `src/main/resources/data.sql`.
- Example queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM doctors;
  SELECT * FROM doctor_schedules;
  SELECT * FROM appointments;
  SELECT * FROM symptom_analyses;
  SELECT * FROM recommendations;
  ```

```

### Symptoms

```

- Cancel appointment

curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/1 | jq
```

## Troubleshooting
- If the app fails to build or run with Maven, make sure you are using Java 17+ (recommended 21).
- If H2 console doesnâ€™t open, confirm `spring.h2.console.enabled=true` and the path `/h2-console` in `application.yml`.
